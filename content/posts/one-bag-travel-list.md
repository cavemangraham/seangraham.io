### The Idea

Travel the world. Work less while learning, seeing, and experiencing more. And do all that while actually SAVING money rather than spending it. Harness the power of the internet to earn a first world salary while living in a developing nation.

Sounds too good to be true? Well, theres just one small catch: you have to cram your whole life and everything you own into a **single carry-on bag.**

Challenge accepted!

### The Bag

![](/uploads/homebase_bag.jpg)

I probably spent 20+ hours looking for a bag that would fit all my needs. If I'm going to be cramming my entire life into it for months or possibly years on end its a huge decision. The bag would basically be like my house.

I wanted something that was water-resistant, compact, and not overly burdened by random pockets and extraneous features. Top contenders were the Minaal 2.0(a bit pricey at $299 and I just naturally distrust kickstarter products), Osprey Farpoint 40(too Jansport-y), GoRuck GR2(Way too expensive at $399 and too heavy). I eventually settled on the [Tortuga Homebase](https://www.tortugabackpacks.com/products/homebase-digital-nomad-travel-backpack) because although its deceptively small, with only 32L capacity, the main compartment is wide open. It also has zippers that go all the way around the compartment so it can be opened like a clamshell. This makes it super easy to pack and get access to clothing or your toiletries bag without disturbing anything else. My first trip to Thailand I brought a single-column hiking bag and it was very difficult to pull something out of the bag without unpacking the whole thing every time. Dumping all your clothes out on a dirty airport floor gets old extremely quickly, trust me.

Having just three main compartments simplifies packing and makes it really easy for me to know where my things are rather than having to hunt through a dozen small pockets. Under the main compartment is where I store my laptop, work notepad, and an ultra-thin ASUS LED screen. The outermost section has everything I want quick access to like my kindle, notebook + pens, chargers, and passport.

### Clothing - 25 Items

**3** [**Lululemon Surge Sock**](https://shop.lululemon.com/p/men-socks/Surge-Sock/_/prod8520007?color=LM9626S_0002&skuId=3774581&locale=en_US&sl=US&CAWELAID=120278590000311002&CID=Google_Fetch_SHOP_A165_A822_C017432&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzIzWBRDnARIsAAkc8hELWngx6KTMkJteqHuIu2b_P3sFEoEIITqfuF0CEqRam82KHQfIQfEaAkCFEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) - I don't know why women's sock technology is so far ahead of men's but Lululemon socks fit great and resist odors which is key for me since my feet are known for their toxic properties.

**5 pair Athletic Boxer Briefs** - Got these at Target or something. Not very exciting. Move along.

**Thick Hiking Socks** - Something thicker and higher to help prevent blisters and help protect a bit from ticks while hiking.

**Under Armour Leggings** - Folds down to almost nothing since its so thin but can be layered under shorts or pants for colder nighttime or mountainous temperatures.

**Patagonia Houdini Rain Shell** - Found this on sale for half-off but the only catch was I had to get it in a color other than black. This whole minimal travel experiment has basically turned me into a goth so it was probably a blessing in disguise.

**2 Cotton Tanktops**

**Under Armour Longsleeve with Hood** - Thicker than the leggings but still folds down to almost nothing while being able to trap a lot of heat if stacked with a tshirt and my rain shell.

[**Grey Express Tshirt**](https://www.express.com/clothing/men/flex-stretch-deep-v-neck-tee/pro/5051301/color/GRAY) **-** Express makes great fitting tshirts. I would bring a dozen of these if I had the space or if I were going somewhere colder than SE Asia.

**3** [**Uniqlo Airisms**](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/men-airism-boxer-briefs-404999COL09SMB004000.html?s=shopping&gclid=Cj0KCQiA5aTUBRC2ARIsAPoPJk_V3ZI_fJBnMWGROyouTkecVZItQCvRrHOAYCjqhCHkO1PNH-y1Lv4aAhW6EALw_wcB) - I read some really over-the-top reviews for these and although they're ultralight and breathable they didn't like change my life or anything. This is the first time I've ever had to deal with an overhyped underwear situation.

**3** [**Ultrathin Modal Tshirts**](https://www.amazon.com/David-Archy-Underwear-V-Neck-Undershirts/dp/B00H4SOJ2Q) - "Modal" is a magic space fabric thats super light and extremely soft on your skin. They also fold down to almost nothing which is great for saving space and weight.

[**Lululemon ABC Pant**](https://shop.lululemon.com/p/men-pants/ABC-Pant-Classic-34/_/prod3470051?color=26857) - These look like dress pants but feel and stretch like pajamas. Really great for the airport since it has a handy front-right zipper pocket perfectly shaped to secure your passport.

**3** [**Birddogs Shorts**](https://www.birddogs.com/collections/the-gym-shorts?gclid=Cj0KCQjwzIzWBRDnARIsAAkc8hEaevivnHmyzUvB0jxgBeXdOX7Xlu--5A8UoiaWYf_FrIwJVA0KaXoaArGNEALw_wcB) - These shorts double as swim trunks and feature a comfortable inner liner which is helpful since going "commando" can be much more comfortable in the tropics. They have two zipper pockets in addition to the front pockets which are perfect for storing my phone and keys so I can jump into a handstand at any moment without stuff falling out, which comes up way more often than you'd think.

### Footwear - 2 Items

![](/uploads/IMG_3889.JPG)

**Reef Flip Flops** - Perfect shoe for summer and the tropics. Very durable as each pair I've had lasts me 3-4 years of daily summer use before finally falling apart. I used to get the kind with the bottle opener on the bottom but then my father pointed out that I was putting a surface that regularly touches dog shit onto the the part of the bottle where my mouth was gonna go... alas, the model without a bottle opener is cheaper anyways.

[**Black Leather Sanuk Loafer**](https://www.amazon.com/Sanuk-Chibalicious-Deluxe-Slip-Loafer/dp/B06WRVK359) - I call these my "business slippers" since they're extremely comfortable but can also work as "business casual" if I need to look presentable. They're also really easy to slip off at the airport when going through security so no one thinks you're harboring foot-bombs.

### Technology - 6 Items

![](/uploads/IMG_3869.JPG)

**Mid 2012 Mac Book Pro** - Got this off of craigslist when I was in college and had decided to get serious about programming. Still more than handles my workload despite having a broken HDMI port.

**Iphone 6** - Not shown since it was taking the picture. Unlocked so I can replace the simcard with local prepaid options wherever I go.

[**Kindle Paperwhite**](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-6-Inch-4GB-eReader/dp/B00OQVZDJM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1522795171&sr=8-1&keywords=kindle+paperwhite+e-reader) - While I love the feeling and smells of flipping through a physical book but theres just no way to beat having an entire library fit in your pocket. The impressively efficient e-ink screen keeps it running for weeks without having to worry about charging. Reading is definitely the easiest way to kill 5 hours at an airport for me personally so this is a must-have for travel.

[**Anker Power Bank**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Z9QVE4Q/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - When your phone battery dies in a third world country and you have no idea where you are you'll really wish you had one of these in your pack. About the size of a deck of playing cards and can recharge my phone 4+ times before running out of juice.

**Chromecast V1** - Just found out theres a new-fangled V2 that has a 4x faster connection so will probably upgrade very soon. Basically it acts like a wireless HDMI cable so I can stream content from my hard drive onto any tv or monitor.

**Asus LED USB Monitor** -

**Apple Headphones**

### Notes - 5 Items

![](/uploads/IMG_3891.JPG)

**Carton Supply Grid Notebook** - Got this from Michael's right before I left as I kept filling up my hardcover notebooks too quickly. I didn't want lined paper since I draw a lot of diagrams and I didn't want blank pages just in case I decided to make Todo lists so I compromised with a faintly gridded paper that can do both.

**Legal Notepad** - This is where I put all of my daily and weekly tasks so I can keep good track of what I'm doing (or, more likely, NOT doing) every day. Ticking boxes can be very addicting.

**3** [**Zebra F-701 Pens**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KCY5OC8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) **each with a** [**Fisher Space Pen Refill**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007T9E2KY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - Found these while I was looking for tougher, refillable option rather than a plastic ballpoint. These metal pens fit the bill for durability too and are really popular in the EDC(Every Day Carry) crowd. The refill choice was heavily inspired by the "Astronaut Pen" episode of Seinfeld. But who cares as long as it writes upside down and in the rain, right?

### Paperwork - 2 Items

**Wallet** - Black leather wallet that I've had since I turned 18. One of the best birthday gifts I've ever gotten and its served me perfectly since then.

**Passport** - Don't lose this. Or bad things happen.

### Toiletries - 9 Items

![](/uploads/IMG_3878.JPG)

**Safety Razor and Replacement Blades** - Can't remember where I got this but it should last me forever. Razor blades are universal so I won't have to worry about finding a specific kind of disposable razor head while I'm abroad(which i hear is a hassle).

[**Lush Dirty Styling Cream**](https://www.lushusa.com/hair/styling/dirty-hair-cream/03104.html) - Great stuff. Helps me stay perfectly quaffed even after 20 hour plane rides.

[**Lush Argan Oil Shampoo Bar**](https://www.lushusa.com/hair/shampoo-bars/jason-and-the-argan-oil/05564.html) - Solid shampoo is a great way to not have to worry about TSA bottle sizes or liquids opening up and leaking on all your clothes. It also seems to last longer than a liquid of the same quantity.

[**Universal Drain Plug**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038JE650/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - I'm glad I read about someone packing this because I never would've thought of it. Its used for plugging any sink or bathtub to easily handwash your clothes. Thats part of the reason for all the synthetic, quick drying fabric in my wardrobe.

Oral-B Pulse Toothbrush - Toothbrushes that vibrate help your gums and this was the smallest one I could find. Unfortunately the by being the smallest it also means its disposable since the battery and brush head aren't replaceable. I really wanted something like [this](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/be-the-first-battery-free-powered-toothbrush--3#/) which is a powered toothbrush that runs off kinetic energy rather than batteries but unfortunately its still in prototype/crowdsource-hell stages so its not worth the risk.

Toothpaste

Floss

[Toiletry Bag](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073XDGB8H/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

### Misc - 4 Items

![](/uploads/IMG_3874.JPG)

[Blender Sunglasses](https://www.blenderseyewear.com/collections/top-selects-blenders-eyewear/products/nocturnal-q) - Generic black wayfarers. Thailand makes great Ray-bans knockoffs so they'll probably be replaced soon.

[Douglass L Field Lighter](https://urbanedcsupply.com/products/douglass-field-l-lighter) - I got this to replace using disposable plastic Bic lighters. First, I tried to use a Zippo but the fuel evaporates every week whether you used it or not. I hate maintenance like that so I found this WW1-inspired lighter thats handcrafted in Japan. It has an O-ring so the fuel inside it will last up to a year without "going dry".

[Universal Travel Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OFRGEEK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - Basic adapter with some extra USB outlets on the side. Very important to get a universal one rather than lugging around a bunch of different power blocks.

[Microfiber Towel](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073RLH9M6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - Microfiber towels kinda suck. They feel like you're rubbing a super thin napkin on yourself rather than a fluffy beach towel BUT they fold down to almost nothing and dry really quickly so I figure its good to have it around. Towelie AND Douglas Adams can't be wrong so its always advised to bring a towel.

## Summary - 48 Items Total\*

I studied a half dozen or so minimal packing lists from various blogs as well as my own research and testing to get to this list of items. I'm sure my packing choices will only get more refined while I'm on the road so it will be interesting to see how my packing list changes over time. Hopefully someone out there doing the same research I did will find this rundown useful in some way. Either way these 48 items are now my entire life so I hope I've made some good choices but only time will tell.

\*I cheated a bit by not counting any small stuff like credit cards, charging cables,  or power blocks but its my list so I'll cheat if I want to!
