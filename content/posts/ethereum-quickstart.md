Ethereum is like a decentralized mainframe where you have to pay for each operation such as writing data or storing state. Programmable Bitcoin. It allows for decentralized infrastructure that can be more secure, scalable, and free.

Still in the very early days of the technology. Support, information, and tooling is growing very rapidly. Infura/Truffle/geth. Solidity is accessible to web developers since its like javascript.

Like the early days of the app store there are still a lot of issues to solve but there is also a lot of opportunity for creativity and experimentation in the space. A lot of very hard problems need to be solved for it to become a ubiquitous technology.
