+++
5 Months ago I left behind the comfort of my grey cubicle at Verizon and started living like a nomad. I decided I would travel to a new country every month. Here are some of the things I've learned:

I don't work well from coworking spaces. I do my best work from the comfort of my bed.

Travel is cheap as long as you're flexible and it's even cheaper if you're willing to suffer (hello 15 hour layover, my old friend).

'Low season' is your friend.

Changing your environment is the easiest way to change your habits.

Sunlight is an important factor for my mental health.

Running a business generates the best and worst feelings in the world.

More underwear, less pants.

Loneliness is optional.
