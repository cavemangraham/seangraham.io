title = "Amazon Echo: The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"

+++
I received a 2nd Gen Amazon Echo as a gift and have been using it semi-regularly for the past 3 months actively testing all of its capabilities since I have been interested in Conversational Ui as a platform for about a year now. 

My initial thoughts are that it is in your best interest to change the "Wake Word" name in the settings from the default: "Alexa" to one of its alternates, "Echo". "Echo" is a whole syllable shorter than "Alexa". 2 vs 3. So really its 33.34% shorter for a word you are going to have to say every time you want to use the device. Imagine how many minutes and hours of your life you'll get back!

Anywhoo, have you ever seen a story on the news where someone's tv activates their devices on purpose? Some ads have even put things into people's shopping carts without their permission. But all of them use "Alexa" as the trigger word because that is what the default is and thus the majority of people. So changing the name of the Wake Word to "Echo" you are joining a smaller pool of users and large scale exploitations via TV or online ads will target the largest percentage of users which requires using "Alexa" as the trigger word.

The things that the echo does well that make it at least somewhat useful are: Playing music, Ordering Certain Items, Asking Simple Questions.

The ability I enjoy the most is being able to play music or start a playlist just using my voice. It is way easier to say: "Echo, play music" or "Echo, play jazz" than to type it into an app or even get out my phone/laptop. I can request songs from the shower or while my hands are busy cooking. Or if you're working out you can change music without having to stop.

Ordering garbage bags on prime was an enlightening experience. I wanted to test what the ordering was like and I also didn't feel like going on an errand to get garbage bags. So I said "Echo, order me garbage bags." It thought for a split second and replied: "The top choice for garbage bags are Black Garbage Bag 60 pieces. That will be $12 dollars. Free shipping and it will arrive tomorrow."

I said. "Yes, thats perfect"

It charged the card I had on file and shipped it to the default address which was my apartment at the time. I even got an email confirmation so I knew exactly what transaction has taken place. Voila. Amazon is such a great enabler of my laziness.

Simple questions like "What temperature is it? Whats the weather like today? Whats traffic like(gives you the time of your commute according to local traffic data)? When was America founded? Who was Amelia Earhart?

The Bad is 90 percent of the skills/apps being made for it are totally unusable garbage. Most of the games i found excruciatingly boring and clumsy to control via voice. 

The Ugly is the amount of times its has no clue what you're asking is very high for something thats supposed to be a more efficient interface than you phone or laptop. When you are directly on the beaten path of "command line-esque" 4 word inputs everything is smooth and then once you're off that track and need any kind of clarification the experience will get frustrating and shitty really quickly.

First it was with text-bots, then building chatbots that interact over facebook messenger. One of the interesting things about a conversational agent is that it can, in theory, reach out to you right as its needed rather than the user having to initiate a query or question. From a business perspective it also makes it a theoretically much higher conversion rates are with one KEY caveat: you have to not annoy them or else it is spam and they will hate you. Your customers need to love you if you want them to spend money. So the majority of your messages need to be "value-add" to the person's life. It needs to be super easy to do and with very little "friction". As few queries and as simple "ease of saying" commands and instructions.

JUMPER

the two brothers? wanna and didya? goals and then a question of followthrough? with neccessary deadlines?

chatbot therapy

textbot for ordering in a large stadium via your ticket being linked to your account or via QR code on the seat in front of them with "delivery info" already baked into the "dialing address" from the location of the different qr codes.

then you can push out a deal to them and trigger their smooth buying process so they just have to say yes or no. exploding offers?
