I received a 2nd Gen Amazon Echo as a gift and have been using it semi-regularly for the past 3 months actively testing all of its capabilities since I have been interested in Conversational Ui as a platform for about a year now. 

My initial thoughts are that it is in your best interest to change the "Wake Word" name in the settings from the default: "Alexa" to one of its alternates, "Echo". "Echo" is a whole syllable shorter than "Alexa". 2 vs 3. So really its 33.34% shorter for a word you are going to have to say every time you want to use the device. Imagine how many minutes and hours of your life you'll get back!

Anywhoo, have you ever seen on the news stories where someone's tv activates their devices on purpose. Some ads have even put thing into people's shopping carts without their permission. But all of them use "Alexa" as the trigger word because that is what the default is and thus the majority of people. So changing the name of the Wake Word to "Echo" you are joining a smaller pool of users and large scale exploitations via TV or online ads will target the largest percentage of users which requires using "Alexa" as the trigger word.

The things that the echo does well that make it at least somewhat useful are: Playing music, Ordering Certain Items, Asking Simple Questions.

First it was with text-bots, then building chatbots that interact over facebook messenger. One of the interesting things about a conversational agent is that it can, in theory, reach out to you right as its needed rather than the user having to initiate a query or question. From a business perspective it also makes it a theoretically much higher conversion rates are with one KEY caveat: you have to not annoy them or else it is spam and they will hate you. Your customers need to love you if you want them to spend money. So the majority of your messages need to be "value-add" to the person's life. It needs to be super easy to do and with very little "friction". As few queries and as simple "ease of saying" commands and instructions.

textbot for ordering in a large stadium via your ticket being linked to your account or via QR code on the seat in front of them with "delivery info" already baked into the "dialing address" from the location of the different qr codes.

then you can push out a deal to them and trigger their smooth buying process so they just have to say yes or no. exploding offers?
