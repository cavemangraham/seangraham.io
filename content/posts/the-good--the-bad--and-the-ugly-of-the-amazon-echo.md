I received a 2nd Gen Amazon Echo as a gift and have been using it semi-regularly for the past 3 months actively testing all of its capabilities since I have been interested in Conversational Ui as a platform for about a year now. First it was with text-bots, then building chatbots that interact over facebook messenger. One of the interesting things about a conversational agent is that it can, in theory, reach out to you right as its needed rather than the user having to initiate a query or question. From a business perspective it also makes it a theoretically much higher conversion rates are with one KEY caveat: you have to not annoy them or else it is spam and they will hate you. Your customers need to love you if you want them to spend money. So the majority of your messages need to be "value-add" to the person's life. It needs to be super easy to do and with very little "friction". As few queries and as simple "ease of saying" commands and instructions.

textbot for ordering in a large stadium via your ticket being linked to your account or via QR code on the seat in front of them with "delivery info" already baked into the "dialing address" from the location of the different qr codes.

then you can push out a deal to them and trigger their smooth buying process so they just have to say yes or no. exploding offers?
