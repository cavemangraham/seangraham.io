JAMstack refers to the use of Javascript, APIs, and Markup to creating websites that are fast, reliable, and secure. I built this website using Jekyll as my site builder, Netlify for free static hosting and SSL, and Forestry.io to make it easy to update the site and add new articles.

What this means for me is that the site is very light, very fast, secure, and cheap since I don't need to pay for a hosting plan every month.
