Hi, I'm Sean.

<p><span> I'm an entrepreneur, programmer, and <span style="color: #f07652" id="textslide">problem solver</span></span>.</p>

I am currently in San Francisco building my experimental software studio [Hyperdrive Labs](www.hyperdrivelabs.com).

I do lots of handstands and regularly eat my bodyweight in stromboli, tacos, and sushi.
