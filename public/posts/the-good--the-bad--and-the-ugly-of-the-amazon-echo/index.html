  <h1>Amazon Echo: The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly <aside></aside></h1>
  <p>I received a 2nd Gen Amazon Echo as a gift and have been using it semi-regularly for the past 3 months actively testing all of its capabilities since I have been interested in Conversational Ui as a platform for about a year now.</p>

<p>The things that the echo does well that make it at least somewhat useful are: Playing music, Ordering Certain Items, Answering Simple Questions.</p>

<p><img src="https://sitecdn.tvpage.com/live/users/1758166/canvas/1261/692/317069742-021261694.jpg" alt="" />Anywho, have you ever seen a story on the news where someone&rsquo;s tv activates their devices on purpose? Some ads have even put things into people&rsquo;s shopping carts without their permission. But all of them use &ldquo;Alexa&rdquo; as the trigger word because that is what the default is and thus the majority of people. So changing the name of the Wake Word to &ldquo;Echo&rdquo; you are joining a smaller pool of users and large scale exploitations via TV or online ads will target the largest percentage of users which requires using &ldquo;Alexa&rdquo; as the trigger word.</p>

<p>The ability I enjoy the most is being able to play music or start a playlist just using my voice. It is way easier to say: &ldquo;Echo, play music&rdquo; or &ldquo;Echo, play jazz&rdquo; than to type it into an app or even get out my phone/laptop. I can request songs from the shower or while my hands are busy cooking. Or if you&rsquo;re working out you can change music without having to stop. Whenever I am reading a book and the author describes a song thats playing during the scene I ask my Echo to play it so that I can get in the vibe of the scene.</p>

<p>Ordering garbage bags on prime was an enlightening experience. I wanted to test what the ordering was like and I also didn&rsquo;t feel like going on an errand to get garbage bags. So I said &ldquo;Echo, order me garbage bags.&rdquo; It thought for a split second and replied: &ldquo;The top choice for garbage bags are Black Garbage Bag 60 pieces. That will be $12 dollars. Free shipping and it will arrive tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said. &ldquo;Yes, thats perfect&rdquo;</p>

<p>It charged the card I had on file and shipped it to the default address which was my apartment at the time. I even got an email confirmation so I knew exactly what transaction has taken place. Voila. Amazon is such a great enabler of my laziness.</p>

<p>Simple questions like &ldquo;What temperature is it? Whats the weather like today? Whats traffic like(gives you the time of your commute according to local traffic data)? When was America founded? Who was Amelia Earhart?</p>

<p>The Bad is 90 percent of the skills/apps being made for it are totally unusable garbage. Most of the games i found excruciatingly boring and clumsy to control via voice.</p>

<p>The Ugly is the amount of times its has no clue what you&rsquo;re asking is very high for something thats supposed to be a more efficient interface than you phone or laptop. When you are directly on the beaten path of &ldquo;command line-esque&rdquo; 4 word inputs everything is smooth and then once you&rsquo;re off that track and need any kind of clarification the experience will get frustrating and shitty really quickly.</p>

<p>Conversational interfaces might never be more efficient than your phone or laptop for most tasks but it already does some things very well. Its capabilities will only grow from this point as more of the interaction design issues are ironed out and better hardware, data, and machine learning models come onto the market.</p>
